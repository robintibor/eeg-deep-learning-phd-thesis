    "Finally, I conclude this thesis with my thoughts on the current state of EEG deep learning decoding and promising avenues for further work like cross-dataset decoding models, models that can process larger timescales of EEG signals, multimodal models and in-context learning.\n",

    "## State of EEG Decoding Using Our Deep Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our deep networks have shown good performance on a wide variety and settings of EEG brain-signal-decoding tasks, from classical movement-related trial-based decoding recording-based automatic pathology diagnosis. They can perform as well or better than feature-based baselines both on scalp and intracranial EEG. Here, fairly generic architectures like our deep ConvNet show robust performance across a wide variety of settings provided they are given enough training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations show these deep networks to learn well-known features like spectral amplitude, while also being capable of learning more complex features. Existing visualizations both reveal more complex waveforms than pure sinusoidal filters, as well as hierarchical features like a temporal increase in the amplitude of a learned frequency feature. Using invertible networks, we were even able to discover predictive features in less commonly used parts of the frequency spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "On several datasets, the decoding performance gap between deeper networks and either smaller networks or even feature-based approaches it not as substantial as in other fields of machine learning like computer vision. Still, results show one advantage of deep networks, namely the possibility to use the same model across many tasks and settings, as the more generic network architectures can learn a wide variety of features suitable for different EEG decoding problems. Also, the results presented in this thesis show some promise to discover different learned EEG features through the use of deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Using neural network architectures that can learn across datasets with different electrode configurations may help improve decoding performance. Here, transformer-based architectures {cite:p}`DBLP:conf/nips/VaswaniSPUJGKP17` are a promising option, as they can be fed electrode coordinates as position encodings, potentially allowing to train them across datasets with different electrode configurations by simply supplying them the electrode coordinates of the current input. This could help to further increase the training data and thereby increase the EEG decoding performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another architectural innovation for better decoding performance could be architectures that process larger time scales. Here, both transformed-based {cite:p}`bigbird,etc,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2004-05150,longt5,DBLP:journals/tacl/RoySVG21,block_recurrent_transformers,DBLP:conf/nips/DaoFERR22` and novel variants of convolutional architectures {cite:p}`DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2302-06646,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2302-10866` may be promising, as recent research has enabled them to process longer temporal sequences. This way, these architectures may for example look at an entire EEG recording at once to determine whether it is pathological. One challenge for this approach is  that processing larger time windows instead of smaller ones decreases the training data again and more regularization may be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimodal neural networks that can process the EEG signal as well as a textual description or other metadata could also improve decoding performance or used as interpretability tools. While models that get both text and signal as input could simply be used to improve decoding performance, models that go from textual description to EEG signal or vice versa {cite}`pmlr-v106-biswal19a,de2022learning` may also help interpretability by textually summarizing a given EEG signal or visualizing a typical EEG signal corresponding to a specific textual report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in-context learning is a method that might also lead to better EEG decoding performance by learning across different datasets and still exploiting the distribution of a specific dataset during inference. In-context-learning refers to trained networks that can learn to solve a novel task simply by being given input/output examples without further training {cite:p}`DBLP:conf/iclr/XieRL022, DBLP:conf/emnlp/MinLHALHZ22,DBLP:conf/iclr/0005HPGH22`. Prominently observed in large language models, such behavior can also be explicitly trained for by training a model on entire labeled training datasets and unlabeled test datasets as input, optimizing to predict the correct test labels {cite:p}`DBLP:conf/iclr/0005HPGH22,tabpfn`. Given a sufficiently large EEG dataset, one may train such a model to process all the training data of a single subject to predict the test data of the same subject. Trained this way, it can learn robust features that work across subjects while still being able to exploit subject-specific features for prediction. One may also consider training on synthetic EEG data to have an unlimited number of datasets during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, combining in-context-learning with dataset condensation methods may help interpretability. Dataset condensation means to learn a smaller synthetic training dataset to replace the original training data {cite:p}`DBLP:conf/icml/MaclaurinDA15,DBLP:conf/iclr/ZhaoMB21,DBLP:conf/icml/ZhaoB21,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1811-10959`. After training the in-context-learning model across many datasets, one could synthesize a small labeled training dataset that yields good performance on a given test dataset. Simply visualizing the examples in this synthesized training set may already reveal discriminative features, similar in spirit, but potentially more powerful than the class prototypes shown in {ref}`understanding-pathology`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Overall, EEG decoding using deep learning already works well, showing competitive decoding performance and revealing interesting learned features. Adopting more recent deep learning methods as the ones mentioned above may improve both aspects further."
