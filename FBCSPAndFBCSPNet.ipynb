FBCSP is an EEG-decoding algorithm that has been successfully used in task-related EEG-decoding competitions {cite}`tangermann_review_2012`. FBCSP aims to decode task-related changes in signal amplitude in different frequencies, such as a decrease in the amplitude of alpha and beta-band oscillations during movement imagination. In the following, we will explain how FBCSP decodes two classes of EEG signals by finding frequency-specific spatial filters that transform the signal, such that it has relatively high variance for one class and low variance for the other class and vice versa."

    " The basic building block of FBCSP is the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. CSP is used to decode brain signals that lead to a change in the amplitudes of the EEG signal with a specific spatial topography {cite}`koles_spatial_1990,ramoser_optimal_2000,blankertz_optimizing_2008`. To do that, CSP aims to maximize the ratio of the signal variance between spatially filtered signals of two classes, e.g. of the signal during two different movements. For example, the signal of a spatial filter computed by CSP may have a very large variance during movements of the left hand and a very small variance during movements of the right hand. Concretely, we are given signals $X_{1}, X_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n x k x t}$ from $n$ EEG trials (can be different for $X_1, X_2$), $k$ EEG electrodes and $t$ timepoints within each trial. CSP then finds a spatial filter $w$ that maximize the ratio of the variances of the spatially filtered $X_1,X_2$:\n",

    "Rather than just finding a single spatial filter $w$, CSP is typically used to find a whole matrix of spatial filters $W^{kxk}$, with spatial filters ordered by the above variance ratio and orthogonal to each other. So the first filter $w_1$ results in the largest variance ratio and the last filter $w_k$ results in the smallest variance ratio. Different algorithms can then be used to subselect some set of filters to filter signals for a subsequent decoding algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSP-filtered signals can be used to construct features to train a classifier. Since the CSP-filtered signals should have very different variances for the different classes, the natural choice is to use the per-trial variances of the CSP-filtered signals as features. This results in as many features per trial as the number of CSP filters that were selected for decoding. Typically, one applies the logarithm to the variances to get more standard-normally distributed features."

For example, during movement the alpha rhythm may be suppressed for multiple electrodes covering a fairly large region on the scalp while the high gamma rhythm would be amplified for a few electrodes covering a smaller region."
