    "Machine learning (ML), i.e., using data to learn programs that perform a desired task, has the potential to benefit medical applications. Compared to humans, machine-learning programs can process larger amounts of data and may extract different information. For example, machine-learning algorithms have processed the large amounts of signals recorded in an intensive-care unit to predict kidney failure {cite:p}`rank2020deep,tomavsev2019clinically` or diagnose breast cancer using high-frequency features usually ignored by doctors {cite:p}`makino2022differences`. Used in this way, machine learning may improve medical interventions, enable new assistive devices and advance scientific understanding."

    "Brain-signal decoding is an especially interesting problem to tackle with machine learning. Brain signals contain a lot of information, yet are hard to interpret for humans. Additionally, more brain signals can be recorded than humans could possibly process. For example, machine-learning algorithms have been developed to help doctors triage patients by quickly detecting stroke biomarkers from computed tomography (CT) {cite:p}`chavva2022deep`, to enable brain-computer interfaces by recognizing people's intentions from electroencephalographic (EEG) in real time  {cite:p}`abiri2019comprehensive` and to detect pathology from long brain signal recordings {cite:p}`gemein2020machine,schirrmeisterdeeppathology`. Also, as brain signals are far from being fully understood, machine-learning algorithms have the potential to advance scientific understanding by finding new brain-signal biomarkers for different pathologies {cite:p}`raghu2020survey`."

    "Electroencephalographic (EEG) brain-signal recordings are well-suited for machine learning since they are easy to acquire, while being time-consuming and challenging to manually interpret by doctors. Generating large EEG datasets is relatively simple compared to other medical recordings because of the low cost and minimal side effects of performing EEG recordings.  Furthermore, EEG recordings are particularly challenging for humans to interpret, making them a promising target for information extraction through machine learning. Some clinical applications of EEG such as pathology diagnosis may be improved by machine learning, while others such as brain-computer interfaces are even only possible because of it. Finally, since the information contained in the EEG signal is far from being fully understood, machine learning may even help understand the EEG signal itself better."

    "Deep learning is a very promising approach for brain-signal decoding from EEG. The term deep learning describes machine-learning models with multiple computational stages, where the computational stages are typically trained jointly to solve a given task {cite:p}`lecun_deep_2015,schmidhuber_deep_2015`. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) are deep learning models that are  inspired by computational structures in the visual cortex of the brain and have in recent times become very successful models for a wide variety of tasks, including object detection in images, speech recognition from audio or machine translation.  ConvNets only have very general assumptions about the properties of their training signals embedded into them (such as smoothness and local-to-global hierarchical structure) and have shown great success on a variety of natural signals. Therefore, ConvNets are very promising to apply to hard-to-understand natural signals like EEG signals."

    "Prior to the work presented in this thesis, it was unclear how well ConvNet architectures can decode EEG signals compared to hand-engineered, feature-based approaches. The high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio and large signal variability (e.g., from person to person or even session to session for the same person) of EEG data present challenges that may  be better addressed by feature-based approaches that exploit more specific assumptions about the EEG signal. While there have been previous efforts to apply deep learning to EEG, a systematic study of the performance of modern ConvNets on EEG decoding compared with a strong feature-based baseline and including the impact of network architecture and training hyperparameters, was lacking. Furthermore, research into understanding what features the ConvNets extract from the EEG signal had been limited."

    "We therefore created several ConvNet architectures to thoroughly evaluate on EEG decoding. We first evaluated our ConvNet's decoding performance under a range of different hyperparameter choices on  widely studied movement-related decoding tasks like decoding which limb a person is thinking of moving. On those tasks, we found our ConvNets to perform at least as good as a strong feature-based baseline. The ConvNets also generalized well to a range of other decoding tasks, including other mental imageries, decoding whether a person made or perceived an error, as well as pathology diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also developed visualizations to understand the features the ConvNets extract from the EEG signal, finding that their predictions are sensitive to plausible neurophysiological features.  Using perturbations of spectral features like amplitude and phase, we show topographies of the causal effects of spectral changes on the networks predictions. For decoding of executed movements, these topographies are consistent with known movement-related spectral brain-signal changes like contralateral alpha power decreases (e.g., decrease in alpha power on the right side of the head when moving the left hand). They also suggest that networks learn to use high-gamma information to predict the performed movement. Visualizations of inputs that maximally activate specific units in one of our ConvNets further reveals that the ConvNet has also learned specific timecourses of amplitude changes, going beyond using just averaged spectral features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we more deeply investigated features learned for pathology decoding. Here, we made use of invertible networks, networks that are designed such that you can invert intermediate and final network outputs back to a corresponding input, allowing to visualize output changes in input space. Further, we also developed a smaller network that is specifically designed to be interpretable and train it to mimic the invertible network. Using these methods we can directly show and investigate temporal waveforms with spatial topographies that are associated with pathological or healthy recordings."

    "In this thesis, I will first describe the research on deep learning EEG decoding prior to our work, then proceed to describe the deep network architectures and training methods we developed to rival or surpass feature-based EEG decoding approaches on movement- and other task-related EEG decoding tasks as well as pathology diagnosis. Furthermore, I also describe the visualization methods we developed that suggest the networks are using plausible neurophysiological patterns to solve their tasks. In a separate chapter, I  will delve more deeply into understanding the learned features for pathology decoding, including by using invertible networks. Finally, I conclude with my thoughts on the current state of EEG deep learning decoding and promising avenues for further work like cross-dataset decoding models as well as models that can process larger timescales of EEG signals."
