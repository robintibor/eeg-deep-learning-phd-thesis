Invertible networks assign probabilities to training inputs by mapping them to a latent space and computing their probabilities under a predefined prior in that latent space. However, for real-valued inputs, one has to account for quantization and volume change to ensure this results in a proper probability distribution in the input space. Quantization  refers to the fact that training data often consists of quantized measureuements of underlying continuous data, e.g. digital images can only represent a distinct set of color values.

    "Pure class-conditional generative training may not yield networks that perform well as classifiers. One proposed reason is the relatively small reduction in generative maximum likelihood loss obtainable from providing the class label to the network for high-dimensional inputs, for example much smaller than typical differences between two runs of the same network [REF]. How much one can reduce the loss through providing the class label can be derived from a compression perspective, so using that under Shannon's theorem more probable inputs need less bits to encode than less probable inputs, or more precisely $\\textrm{Number of bits needed}(x) = \\log_2 p(x)$. How many of these bits are needed for the class label in case it is not given? To distinguish between n classes, one needs only $\\log_2(n)$ bits, so in case of binary pathology classification, only 1 bit is needed. However, the inputs themselves typically need at least 1 bit per dimension, so already, a 21 channel x 128 timepoints EEG-signal may need at least 2688 bits to encode. Therefore the optimal class-conditional model will only be 1 bit better than the optimal class-independent model and contribute very little to the overall encoding size. In contrast, the loss difference between two training runs of the same network will typically be at least 1 to two orders of magnitude larger. In practice, the gains from using a class-conditional model, by e.g., using a separate prior per class in latent space, are usually larger, but it is not a priori clear if the reductions in loss from exploiting the class label are high enough to result in a good classification model.\n",

Example EEG input on the left, then processing steps on the right: spatial filtering, absolute cosine similarity with temporal filters, temporal averaging, then weighting with linear classifier weights for class prediction. Note the EEG-CosNet in this visualization only uses 8 filters, whereas later we will use 64 filters.\n",

    "Finally, we also implemented a small convolutional network EEG-CosNet that we designed to be directly interpretable. We tried to distill the trained EEG-InvNet into the EEG-CosNet by training the EEG-CosNet using the EEG-InvNet class probabilities as the targets for the classification loss $L_\\textrm{class}$. Our EEG-CosNet consists of just three steps:\n",

    "Steps 1 and 2 yield spatiotemporal patterns that can be visualized as waveforms and scalp plots, and that are weighted by the linear classifier for the respective classes. We chose cosine similarity to ensure that high output values correspond to spatially filtered signals that resemble the corresponding temporal filter. The spatial filter weights and linear classifier weights can be made even more interpretable through transforming the discriminative weights into generative patterns  by multiplying them with the covariance of the electrodes/averaged absolute cosine similarities after training, see {cite:t}`haufe_interpretation_2014` for a discussion on this technique. We use 64 spatiotemporal filters with temporal length 64 corresponding to one second at 64 Hz.\n"
