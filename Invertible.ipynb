    "Invertible networks are networks that are invertible by design, i.e., any network output can be mapped back to a corresponding input [refs] bijectively. The ability to invert any output back to the input enables different interpretability methods and furthermore allows training invertible networks as generative models via maximum likelihood. \n",

    "The background chapter starts by explaining how to design invertible networks, proceeds to detail their training methodologies as generative models or classifiers, and goes on to outline interpretability techniques that help reveal the learned features crucial for their classification tasks. We then present the results of invertible networks trained to decode pathology from EEG, showing competitive results with regular deep convolutional networks. Our visualizations show the network uses slowing, i.e. increased amplitudes in the lower frequencies as well as spikes/burts as markers that indicate pathology and a strong stable alpha rhythm, especially on the posterior electrodes as markers for normal EEG."

    "Invertible networks, a type of neural networks, use layers constructed specifically to maintain invertibility, thereby rendering the entire network structure invertible. Often-used invertible layers are coupling layers, invertible linear layers and activation normalization layers as explained in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coupling layers work by splitting a d-dimensional input $x$ into two parts $x_1$ and $x_2$ of $d_1$ and $d_2$ dimensions with $d_1 + d_2 = d$. For example in a timeseries one may take the input at all the even time indices as $x_1$ and all the odd time indices as $x_2$ odd time indices. Then, one transforms $x_1$ in an invertible way (e.g., by adding something to it) based on computations only performed on $x_2$, while leaving $x_2$ unchanged. For, example additive coupling works as follows:\n",
    "$y_1 = x_1 + f(x_2); y_2=x_2$, with $f$ being an arbitrary function, e.g., any (potentially non-invertible) neural network. It can be inverted given $y_1$ and $y_2$ as follows: $x_1 = y_1 - f(y_2); x_2=y_2$. Instead of addition one may use any other invertible function, a common one is an affine transformation where $f$ produces translation and scaling coefficients $f_t$ and $f_s$:\n",
    "$y_1 = x_1 \\cdot f_s(x_2) + f_t(x_2); y_2=x_2$, with inversion $x_1 = \\frac{(y_1  - f_t(x_2))}{f_s(x_2)}; y_2=x_2$. \n",
    "The splitting of dimensions can be done in multiply ways, like using odd or even indices or using difference and mean between two neighbouring samples (akin to one stage of a Haar Wavelet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Invertible linear layers compute an invertible linear transformation (an automorphism) of their input. Concretely they multiply a $d$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{x}$ with a $dxd$-dimensional matrix $W$, where the $W$ has to be invertible, i.e., have nonzero determinant. \n",
    "$y=W \\mathbf{x}$ with inverse $x=W^{-1} \\mathbf{y}$. For multidimensional arrays like feature maps in a convolutional network, these linear transformations are usually done per-position, as so-called invertible 1x1 convolutions in the 2d case.\n",

    "Invertible networks trained as class-conditional generative models can also be used as classifiers. Class-conditional generative networks may be implemented in different ways, for example with a separate prior in latent space for each class. Given the class-conditional probability densities $p(x|c_i)$, one can obtain class probabilities via Bayes formula as $p(c_i|x)=\\frac{p(x|c_i)}{\\sum_jp(x|c_j)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure class-conditional generative training may not yield networks that perform well as classifiers. The reason is that at least in theory, the relative reductions in maximum likelihood loss one obtains from knowing the class label are very small for high-dimensional inputs, for example much smaller than typical differences between two runs of the same network [REF]. This is understandable from a compression perspective, so using that under Shannon's theorem more probable inputs need less bits to encode than less likely inputs, or more precisely $\\textrm{Number of bits needed}(x) = \\log_2 p(x)$. Even if you assume some one needs only 1 bit per dimension, a high-dimensional input like our 2688-dimensional EEG signal will need 2688 bits to encode. How many bits are needed for the class information? To distinguish between n classes, one needs only $\\log_2(n)$ bits, so in case of binary pathology classification, only 1 bit is needed, therefore the optimal class-conditional model will only be 1 bit better than the optimal class-independent model. In contrast, the loss difference between two training runs of the same network will typically be at least 1 to two orders of magnitude larger. In practice, the gains from using a class-conditional model, by e.g., using a separate prior per class in latent space, are usually larger, but it is not a priori clear if the reductions in loss from exploiting the class label are high enough to result in a good classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various methods have been proposed to improve the performance of using generative classifiers. For example, people have fixed the per-class latent gaussian priors so that they retain the same distance throughout training [Ref Pavel] or added a classification loss term $L_class(x)=\\log_2 (...etc softmax) $ to the training [Ref VIB heidelberg]. In our work, we experimented with adding a classification loss term to the training, and also found using a learned temperature before the softmax helps the training. "
