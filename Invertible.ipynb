    "Invertible networks can also be trained as generative models via maximum likelihood. In maximum likelihood training, the network is optimized to maximize the probabilities of the training inputs. Invertible networks assign probabilities to training inputs by mapping them to a latent space and computing their probabilities under a predefined prior in that latent space. However, for real-valued inputs, one has to account for quantization and volume change to ensure this results in a proper probability distribution in the input space. Quantization  refers to the fact that training data often consists of quantized measureuements of underlying continuous data, e.g. digital images can only represent a distinct set of color values. Volume change refers to how the invertible networks' mapping function expands or squeezes volume from input space to latent space."

    "Pure class-conditional generative training may not yield networks that perform well as classifiers. One proposed reason is the relatively small reduction in generative maximum likelihood loss obtainable from providing the class label to the network for high-dimensional inputs, for example much smaller than typical differences between two runs of the same network [REF]. How much one can reduce the loss through providing the class label can be derived from a compression perspective, so using that under Shannon's theorem more probable inputs need less bits to encode than less probable inputs, or more precisely $\\textrm{Number of bits needed}(x) = \\log_2 p(x)$. How many of these bits are needed for the class label in case it is not given? To distinguish between n classes, one needs only $\\log_2(n)$ bits, so in case of binary pathology classification, only 1 bit is needed. However, the inputs themselves typically need at least 1 bit per dimension, so already, a 21 channel x 128 timepoints EEG-signal may need at least 2688 bits to encode. Therefore the optimal class-conditional model will only be 1 bit better than the optimal class-independent model and contribute very little to the overall encoding size. In contrast, the loss difference between two training runs of the same network will typically be at least 1 to two orders of magnitude larger. In practice, the gains from using a class-conditional model, by e.g., using a separate prior per class in latent space, are usually larger, but it is not a priori clear if the reductions in loss from exploiting the class label are high enough to result in a good classification model.\n",
