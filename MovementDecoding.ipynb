    "Movement-related decoding problems are among the most researched in EEG decoding and were hence our problem of choice for the first evaluation of deep learning on EEG. A typical movement-related experimental setting is that subjects receive a cue for a specific body part (e.g. right hand, feet, tongue, etc.) and either move (motor execution) or imagine to move (motor imagery) this body part. The EEG signals recorded during the imagined or executed movements then often contain patterns specific to the body part being moved or thought about. These patterns can then be decoded using machine learning. In the following, I will describe our study on movement-related EEG decoding using deep learning, mostly using content adapted from {cite:t}`schirrmeisterdeephbm2017` and from {cite:p}`hartmann2018hierarchical`."

The training set consists of the approx. 880 trials of all runs except the last two runs, the test set of the approx. 160 trials of the last 2 runs. This dataset was acquired in an EEG lab optimized for non-invasive detection of high-frequency movement-related EEG components {cite:p}`ball_movement_2008,darvas_high_2010`. Such high-frequency components in the range of approx. 60 to above 100 Hz are typically increased during movement execution and may contain useful movement-related information {cite:p}`crone_functional_1998,hammer_predominance_2016,quandt_single_2012`. Our technical EEG Setup comprised (1.) Active electromagnetic shielding: optimized for frequencies from DC - 10 kHz (-30 dB to -50 dB), shielded window, ventilation \\& cable feedthrough (mrShield, CFW EMV-Consulting AG, Reute, CH) (2.)

The contact impedance from electrodes to skin was typically reduced below 5 kOhm using electrolyte gel (SUPER-VISC, EASYCAP GmbH, Herrsching, GER) and blunt cannulas.

A fixation point was attached at the center of the screen. The subjects\n",
    "were instructed to relax, fixate the fixation mark and to keep as still as possible during the motor execution task. Blinking and swallowing was restricted to the inter-trial intervals. The electromagnetic shielding combined with the comfortable armchair, dimly lit Faraday cabin and the relatively long 3-4 second inter-trial intervals (see below) were used to minimize artifacts produced by the subjects during the trials.\n",

    "The tasks were as following. Depending on the direction of a gray arrow that was shown on black background, the subjects had to repetitively clench their toes (downward arrow), perform sequential finger-tapping of their left (leftward arrow) or right (rightward arrow) hand, or relax (upward arrow). The movements were selected to require little proximal muscular activity while still being complex enough to keep subjects involved. Within the 4-s trials, the subjects performed\n",

Per run, 80 arrows were displayed for 4 s each, with 3 to 4 s of continuous random inter-trial interval.

The stimuli were presented and the data recorded with BCI2000 {cite:p}`schalk_bci2000:_2004`. The experiment was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Freiburg."

Adam is a variant of stochastic gradient descent designed to work well with high-dimensional parameters, which makes it  suitable for optimizing the large number of parameters of a ConvNet {cite}`kingma_adam:_2014`. The early stopping strategy that we use throughout these experiments, developed in the computer vision field [^earlystoppingurl], splits the training set into a training and validation fold and stops the first phase of the training when validation accuracy does not improve for a predefined number of epochs. The training continues on the combined training and validation fold starting from the parameter values that led to the  best accuracies on the validation fold so far. The training ends when the loss function on the validation fold drops to the same value as the loss function on the training fold at the end of the first training phase (we do not continue training in a third phase as in the original description). Early stopping in general  allows training on different types of networks and datasets without choosing the number of training epochs by hand.

The majority of all mistakes were due to discriminating between Hand (L) / Hand (R) and Feet / Rest, see Table {numref}`hgd-class-mistakes-table`. Seven entries of the confusion matrix had a statistically significant difference (p<0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) between the deep and the shallow ConvNet, in all of them the deep ConvNet performed better. Only two differences between the deep ConvNet and FBCSP were statistically significant (p<0.05), none for the shallow  ConvNet and FBCSP. Confusion matrices for the BCI competition IV dataset 2a showed a larger variability and hence a less consistent pattern, possibly because of the much smaller number of trials."

These scalp maps directly reflect the behavior of the ConvNets and one needs to be careful when making inferences about the data from them. For example, the positive correlation on the right side of the scalp for the Hand (R) class in the alpha band only means the ConvNet increased its prediction when the amplitude at these electrodes was increased independently of other frequency bands and electrodes. It does not imply that there was an increase of amplitude for the right hand class in the data. Rather, this correlation could be explained by the ConvNet reducing common noise between both locations, for more explanations of these effects in case of linear models, see {cite}`haufe_interpretation_2014`. Nevertheless, for the first time in noninvasive EEG, these maps clearly revealed the global somatotopic organization of causal contributions of motor cortical gamma band activity to decoding right and left hand and foot movements. Interestingly, these maps revealed highly focalized patterns, particularly during hand movement in the gamma frequency range ({numref}`bandpower-perturbation-topo-fig`, first plots in last row), in contrast to the more diffuse patterns in the conventional task-related spectral analysis as shown in {numref}`envelope-class-fig`."
