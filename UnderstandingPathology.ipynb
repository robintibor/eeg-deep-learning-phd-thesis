    "After our initial work on pathology decoding, we wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the features deep networks learn to distinguish healthy from pathological recordings. For that, we used invertible networks as generative classifiers since they offer more ways to visualize their learned prediction function in input space. We visualize prototypes of the two classes as well as individual electrode signals predictive of a certain class independent of the signals at other electrodes. These visualizations revealed both well-known features as well as surprising patterns in the very low frequencies. To gain an even better understanding, we distilled the invertible network's knowledge into a very small network that is interpretable by design. These visualizations showed regular patterns in the alpha and beta range associated with healthy recordings and a diverse set of more irregular waveforms associated with pathology. All work presented here is novel unpublished work performed in the context of this thesis."

    "We apply our EEG-InvNet to pathology decoding on the same TUH dataset as in {ref}`pathology`. We use only 2 minutes of each recording at 64 Hz, and input 2 seconds as one example to the invertible network. This reduced dataset allows fast experimentation while still yielding good decoding performance. We used AdamW as our optimizer and cosine annealing with restarts every 25 epochs as our learning rate schedule.  We emphasize these details were not heavily optimized for maximum decoding performance, but rather chosen to obtain a robustly performing model worth investigating more deeply. Results in {numref}`table-tuh-invertible-accuracy` show that our EEG-InvNet compares similar than regular ConvNets, even better in some cases."

    "Class prototypes reveal known oscillatory features and surprisingly hint at the use of very-low-frequency information by the invertible network. We inverted the learned latent means of the healthy and the pathological class distributions back to the input space to visualize the most likely healthy and most likely pathological examples under the learned distribution. We differences in the alpha rhythm like a stronger alpha rhythm at O1 in the healthy example. We also see further differences with a variety of different oscillatory patterns present for both classes. Surprisingly, there are also differences in the very low frequencies like substantially different mean values for FP1 and FP2 for the two class prototypes, which we will further investigate later. One challenge of this visualization is that one has to look at each prototype as one complete example and cannot interpret signals at individiual electrodes independently. This is what we tackle in our next visualization."

The pathological prototypes show strong low-frequency activity, for example at T3 and T4, consistent with slowing as a biomarker for pathology. The healthy signal shows alpha activity, for example at C4 and T6.  Besides these patterns, a lot of other interesting patterns may be interesting to further investigate. One of them, the differences in the very low frequencies will be further explored below. Note that it was not possible to synthesize a signal that is clearly indicative of one class independent of the other electrodes for all electrodes.
