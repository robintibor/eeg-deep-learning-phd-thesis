<div><p>We also evaluated our deep ConvNets for automatic medical diagnosis from EEG. EEG is widely used in clinical practice because of its low cost and its lack of side effects. It is important both as a screening method as well as for hypothesis-based diagnostics, e.g., in epilepsy or stroke. One of the main limitations of using EEG for diagnostics is the required time and specialized knowledge of experts that need to be well-trained on EEG diagnostics to reach reliable results. Therefore, a deep-learning approach that aids in the diagnostic process could make EEG diagnosis more widely accessible, reduce time and effort for clinicians and potentially make diagnoses more accurate.</p>

<div><p>We used our deep and shallow ConvNets with only minor modifications to the architecture. To use larger time windows to make a single prediction, we adapted the architectures by changing the final layer filter length so the ConvNets have an input length of about 600 input samples, which correspond to 6 seconds for the 100 Hz EEG input. Additionally, we moved the pooling strides of the deep ConvNet to the convolutional layers directly before each pooling. This modification, which we initially considered a mistake, allowed us to grow the ConvNet input length without strongly increased computation times and
provided good accuracies in preliminary experiments on the training data; therefore we decided to keep it.</p>

<h2>Automatic architecture optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#automatic-architecture-optimization" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We also carried out a preliminary study of automatic architecture optimization to further improve our ConvNet architectures. To that end, we used the automatic hyperparameter optimization algorithm SMAC \cite{hutter_sequential_2011} to optimize architecture hyperparameters of the deep and shallow ConvNets, such as filter lengths, strides and types of nonlinearities. As the objective function to optimize via SMAC, we used 10-fold cross-validation performance obtained on the first 1500 recordings of the training data (using each fold as an instance for SMAC to speed up the optimization).
We set a time limit of 3.5 hours for each configuration run on a single fold. Runs that timed out or crashed (e.g., networks configurations that did not fit in GPU memory) were scored with an accuracy of 0%.</p>

<div><p>Both the deep and the shallow ConvNet outperformed the only results that had been published on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus at the time (see Table \ref{tab:main-results}).
Both ConvNets were more than 5% better than the baseline method of a convolutional network that included multiple fully connected layers at the end and took precomputed EEG features of an entire recording as one input \cite{lopez_automated_2017}.
The ConvNets as applied here reduced the error rate from about 21% to about 15%. We also tested a linear classifier on the same 6-second inputs as our ConvNets. The linear classifier did not reach accuracies substantially different from chance (51.4%).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Interestingly, both of our ConvNet architectures already reached higher accuracies than the baseline when evaluating single predictions from 6-second crops. The average per-crop accuracy of individual predictions was only about 3% lower than average per-recording accuracy (averaged predictions of all crops in a recording). Furthermore, the individual prediction accuracies were already about 3% higher than the per-recording accuracies of the baseline.
This implies that predictions with high accuracies can be made from just 6 seconds of EEG data.</p>

<p>The models discovered by automated architecture optimization were markedly different from our original deep and shallow ConvNets. For example, the optimized architectures used only 1.8 and 3.7 seconds of EEG data for the optimized deep and shallow ConvNet, respectively, in contrast to about 6 seconds in the original versions.
While the improved performance of these modified architectures for the 10-fold cross-validation on the training dataset (2.1% and 1.4% improvement for deep and shallow ConvNets, respectively) did not generalize to the evaluation set (0.9% and  1.5% deterioration for deep and shallow ConvNets, respectively, see <a class="reference internal" href="#pathology-smac-results"><span class="std std-numref">Table 11</span></a>, the modifications to the original network architectures already provided interesting insights for further exploration:
For example, in the case of the shallow ConvNet, the modified architecture did not use any of the original nonlinearities, but used max pooling as the only nonlinearity (see Fig. <a class="reference internal" href="#shallow-smac-net-fig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 33</span></a>), a configuration we had not considered in our  manual search so far.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to better understand what kind of recordings are easier or harder for the ConvNets to correctly decode, we analyzed the textual clinical reports of each recording as included in the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus. %todecide remove last part?
Specifically, we investigated which words were relatively more or less frequent in the incorrectly compared with the correctly predicted recordings.
We performed this analysis independently for both the normal and the pathological class of recordings.
Concretely, for each class, we first computed the relative frequencies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{i-}\)</span> for each word <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_{i-}\)</span> in the incorrectly predicted recordings, i.e.:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{i-} = \frac{|w_{i-}|}{\sum_{i}|w_{i-}|}\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|w_{i-}|\)</span> denotes the number of occurrences for word <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_i\)</span> in the incorrectly predicted recordings.
We then computed the frequencies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{i+}\)</span> in the same way and computed the ratios <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_i=f_{i-}/f_{i+}\)</span>.
Finally, we analyzed words with very large ratios (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gg1\)</span>) and very small ratios (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ll1\)</span>) by inspecting the contexts of their occurrences in the  clinical reports.
This allowed us to gain insights into which clinical/contextual aspects of the recordings correlated with ConvNets failures.</p>
<p>Most notably, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">small</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amount</span></code> had a much larger word frequency (15.5 times larger) in the incorrectly predicted pathological recordings compared with the correctly predicted pathological recordings.
Closer inspection showed this is very sensible, as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">small</span> <span class="pre">amount</span></code> was often used to describe more subtle EEG abnormalities (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">small</span> <span class="pre">amount</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">temporal</span> <span class="pre">slowing</span></code>,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Small</span> <span class="pre">amount</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">excess</span> <span class="pre">theta</span></code>,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Small</span> <span class="pre">amount</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">background</span> <span class="pre">disorganization</span></code>,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">small</span> <span class="pre">amount</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">rhythmic,</span> <span class="pre">frontal</span> <span class="pre">slowing</span></code>), as this subtlety of changes was likely the cause of the classification errors.</p>
<p>Secondly, other words with a notably different frequency were <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">age</span></code> (9.7 times larger) and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sleep</span></code> (3 occurrences in 630 words of texts of incorrectly predicted recordings, not present in texts of correctly predicted recordings).
Both typically indicate the clinician used the age of the subject or the fact that they were (partially) asleep during the recording to interpret the EEG (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Somewhat</span> <span class="pre">disorganized</span> <span class="pre">pattern</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">age</span></code>,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Greater</span> <span class="pre">than</span> <span class="pre">anticipated</span> <span class="pre">disorganization</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">age.</span></code>,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">single</span> <span class="pre">generalized</span> <span class="pre">discharge</span> <span class="pre">noted</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">stage</span> <span class="pre">II</span> <span class="pre">sleep.</span></code>).
Obviously, our ConvNets trained only on EEG do not have access to this context information, leaving them at a disadvantage compared to the clinicians and highlighting the potential of including contextual cues such as age or vigilance in the training/decoding approach.</p>
<p>Inspection of the textual records of misclassified normal recordings did not provide much insight, as they are typically very short (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Normal</span> <span class="pre">EEG.</span></code>,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Normal</span> <span class="pre">EEG</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">wakefulness.</span></code>).</p>
<p>Finally, consistent with the strong usage of the delta and theta frequency range by the ConvNets as seen in the input-perturbation network-prediction correlation maps (<a class="reference internal" href="#perturbation-shallow-pathology-fig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 35</span></a>), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slowing</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">temporal</span></code> are the 6th and 10th most frequently occurring words in the textual reports of the pathological recordings, while never occurring in the textual reports of the normal recordings (irrespective of correct or incorrect predictions).</p>

<div class="section" id="discussion">
<h2>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, the ConvNet architectures used in this study achieved the best accuracies published so far on the TUH EEG Abnormal Corpus.
The architectures used were only very slightly modified versions of ConvNet architectures that we previously introduced to decode task-related information. This suggests that these architectures might be broadly applicable both for physiological and clinical EEG.
The identification of all-round architectures would greatly simplify the application of deep learning to EEG decoding problems and expand their potential use cases.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the ConvNets already reached good accuracies based on very limited time segments of the EEG recordings.
Further accuracy improvements could thus be possible with improved decoding models that can extract and integrate additional information from longer timescales.
The exact nature of such models, as well as the amount of EEG they would require, remains to be determined.
More accurate decoding models could either be ConvNets that are designed to intelligently use a larger input length or recurrent neural networks, since these are known to inherently work well for data with information both on shorter and longer term scales.
Furthermore, combinations between both approaches, for example using a recurrent neural network on top of a ConvNet, as they have been used in other domains like speech recognition <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id192">LW15</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id193">SVSS15</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id209">SSRB15</a>]</span>, are promising.</p>
<p>Our automated architecture optimization provided interesting insights by yielding configurations that were markedly different from our hand-engineered architectures, yet reached similar accuracies. Since the marked improvements in training performance did not improve the evaluation accuracies in this study, in future work, we plan to use more training recordings in the optimization and study different cross-validation methods to also improve evaluation accuracies.
A full-blown architecture search <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id17">MKF+16</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id15">MLM+17</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id16">RMS+17</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id14">ZL16</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id13">ZVSL17</a>]</span> could also further improve accuracy. With such improved methods it would also be important not only to decode pathological vs. normal EEG in a binary fashion, but to also evaluate the possibility to derive more fine-grained clinical information, such as the type of pathological change (slowing, asymmetry, etc) or the likely underlying disorder (such as epilepsy).</p>
<p>Any of these or other improvements might eventually bring the machine-learning decoding performance of pathological EEG closer to human-level performance.
Since clinicians make their judgments from patterns they see in the EEG and other available context information, there is no clear reason why machine learning models with access to the same information could not reach human-level accuracy.
This human-level performance is a benchmark for decoding accuracies that does not exist for other brain-signal decoding tasks, e.g. in decoding task-related information for brain-computer interfaces, where there is inherent uncertainty what information is even present in the EEG and no human-level benchmark exists.</p>
<p>Our perturbation visualizations of the ConvNetsâ€™ decoding behavior showed that they used spectral power changes in the delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range, particularly from temporal EEG channels, possibly alongside other features (<a class="reference internal" href="#perturbation-shallow-pathology-fig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 35</span></a>). This observation is consistent both with the expectations implied by the spectral analysis of the EEG data (<a class="reference internal" href="#bandpower-pathology-fig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 34</span></a>) and by the textual reports that frequently mentioned <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">temporal</span></code>  and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slowing</span></code> with respect to the pathological samples, but never in the normal ones.
Our  perturbation visualization showed results that were consistent with expectations that the ConvNets would use the bandpower differences between the classes that were already visible in the spectra to perform their decoding.
Similarly, the textual reports also yielded plausible insights, e.g., that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">small</span> <span class="pre">amounts</span></code> of abnormalities as indicated in the written clinical reports were more difficult for the networks to decode correctly.
Additionally, inspection of the textual reports also emphasized the importance of  integrating contextual information such as the age of the subject.</p>
<p>Still, to yield more clinically useful insights and diagnosis explanations, further improvements in ConvNet visualizations are needed.
Deep learning models that use an attention mechanism might be more interpretable, since these models can highlight which parts of the recording were most important for the decoding decision.
Other deep learning visualization methods like recent saliency map methods <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id12">KSA+17</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id11">MSM17</a>]</span> to explain individual decisions or conditional generative adversarial networks  <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id18">MO14</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id20">Spr15</a>]</span> to understand what makes a recording pathological or normal might further improve the clinical benefit of deep learning methods that decode pathological EEG.</p>
