    "> We also evaluated our deep ConvNets for automatic medical diagnosis from EEG. EEG is widely used in clinical practice because of its low cost and its lack of side effects. It is important both as a screening method as well as for hypothesis-based diagnostics, e.g., in epilepsy or stroke. One of the main limitations of using EEG for diagnostics is the required time and specialized knowledge of experts that need to be well-trained on EEG diagnostics to reach reliable results. Therefore, a deep-learning approach that aids in the diagnostic process could make EEG diagnosis more widely accessible, reduce time and effort for clinicians and potentially make diagnoses more accurate."

    "Both typically indicate the clinician used the age of the subject or the fact that they were (partially) asleep during the recording to interpret the EEG (`Somewhat disorganized pattern for age`,  `Greater than anticipated disorganization for age.`,  `A single generalized discharge noted in stage II sleep.`). \n",
    "Obviously, our ConvNets trained only on EEG do not have access to this context information, leaving them at a disadvantage compared to the clinicians and highlighting the potential of including contextual cues such as age or vigilance in the training/decoding approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspection of the textual records of misclassified normal recordings did not provide much insight, as they are typically very short (e.g., `Normal EEG.`,  `Normal EEG in wakefulness.`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, consistent with the strong usage of the delta and theta frequency range by the ConvNets as seen in the input-perturbation network-prediction correlation maps ({numref}`perturbation-shallow-pathology-fig`), `slowing` and `temporal` are the 6th and 10th most frequently occurring words in the textual reports of the pathological recordings, while never occurring in the textual reports of the normal recordings (irrespective of correct or incorrect predictions)."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, the ConvNet architectures used in this study achieved the best accuracies published so far on the TUH EEG Abnormal Corpus.\n",
    "The architectures used were only very slightly modified versions of ConvNet architectures that we previously introduced to decode task-related information. This suggests that these architectures might be broadly applicable both for physiological and clinical EEG.\n",
    "The identification of all-round architectures would greatly simplify the application of deep learning to EEG decoding problems and expand their potential use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remarkably, the ConvNets already reached good accuracies based on very limited time segments of the EEG recordings. \n",
    "Further accuracy improvements could thus be possible with improved decoding models that can extract and integrate additional information from longer timescales.\n",
    "The exact nature of such models, as well as the amount of EEG they would require, remains to be determined.\n",
    "More accurate decoding models could either be ConvNets that are designed to intelligently use a larger input length or recurrent neural networks, since these are known to inherently work well for data with information both on shorter and longer term scales.\n",
    "Furthermore, combinations between both approaches, for example using a recurrent neural network on top of a ConvNet, as they have been used in other domains like speech recognition {cite}`li_constructing_2015,sainath_convolutional_2015,sak_fast_2015`, are promising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our automated architecture optimization provided interesting insights by yielding configurations that were markedly different from our hand-engineered architectures, yet reached similar accuracies. Since the marked improvements in training performance did not improve the evaluation accuracies in this study, in future work, we plan to use more training recordings in the optimization and study different cross-validation methods to also improve evaluation accuracies.\n",
    "A full-blown architecture search {cite}`mendoza_towards_2016, miikkulainen_evolving_2017, real_large-scale_2017, zoph_neural_2016, zoph_learning_2017` could also further improve accuracy. With such improved methods it would also be important not only to decode pathological vs. normal EEG in a binary fashion, but to also evaluate the possibility to derive more fine-grained clinical information, such as the type of pathological change (slowing, asymmetry, etc) or the likely underlying disorder (such as epilepsy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any of these or other improvements might eventually bring the machine-learning decoding performance of pathological EEG closer to human-level performance.\n",
    "Since clinicians make their judgments from patterns they see in the EEG and other available context information, there is no clear reason why machine learning models with access to the same information could not reach human-level accuracy.\n",
    "This human-level performance is a benchmark for decoding accuracies that does not exist for other brain-signal decoding tasks, e.g. in decoding task-related information for brain-computer interfaces, where there is inherent uncertainty what information is even present in the EEG and no human-level benchmark exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our perturbation visualizations of the ConvNets' decoding behavior showed that they used spectral power changes in the delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range, particularly from temporal EEG channels, possibly alongside other features ({numref}`perturbation-shallow-pathology-fig`). This observation is consistent both with the expectations implied by the spectral analysis of the EEG data ({numref}`bandpower-pathology-fig`) and by the textual reports that frequently mentioned `temporal`  and `slowing` with respect to the pathological samples, but never in the normal ones.\n",
    "Our  perturbation visualization showed results that were consistent with expectations that the ConvNets would use the bandpower differences between the classes that were already visible in the spectra to perform their decoding.\n",
    "Similarly, the textual reports also yielded plausible insights, e.g., that `small amounts` of abnormalities as indicated in the written clinical reports were more difficult for the networks to decode correctly.\n",
    "Additionally, inspection of the textual reports also emphasized the importance of  integrating contextual information such as the age of the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, to yield more clinically useful insights and diagnosis explanations, further improvements in ConvNet visualizations are needed.\n",
    "Deep learning models that use an attention mechanism might be more interpretable, since these models can highlight which parts of the recording were most important for the decoding decision.\n",
    "Other deep learning visualization methods like recent saliency map methods {cite}`kindermans_patternnet_2017, montavon_methods_2017` to explain individual decisions or conditional generative adversarial networks  {cite}`mirza_conditional_2014, springenberg_unsupervised_2015` to understand what makes a recording pathological or normal might further improve the clinical benefit of deep learning methods that decode pathological EEG."
