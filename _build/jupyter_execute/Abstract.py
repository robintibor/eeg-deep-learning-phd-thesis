# # Deep Learning for Brain-Signal Decoding from Electroencephalography (EEG)

# What a marvelous topic to learn about!
# 
# 
# 
# | Chapter    | Summary    |
# | :--- | ---: |
# | [Introduction](introduction)   |  Deep learning on EEG is a very promising approach for brain-signal-based medical applications like automatic diagnosis  |
# | [Prior Work](prior-work)   | Prior to 2017, research did not clearly show how competitive deep learning is compared with well-optimized feature baselines   |
# | [Neural Network Architectures for EEG-Decoding](network-architectures)   | Starting from a network mimicking an established EEG decoding pipeline, progressively more generic neural network architectures for EEG decoding |
# | [Cropped Training](network-architectures)   | A training strategy to use many sliding windows in a computationally efficient manner |
# | [Perturbation Visualization](perturbation-visualization)   | A visualization of how frequency features affect the trained network and its limitations |
# | [Movement-Related Decoding](movement-related)   | Deep learning can be at least as good as feature-based baselines for movement-related decoding; deep networks also learn to extract known hand-engineered features|
# | [Task-Related Decoding](task-related)   | Deep learning also performs well at other task-related decoding|
# | [Decoding Pathology](pathology)  | Deep networks designed for task-related decoding can also decode pathology well  |
# | [Invertible Networks](invertible-networks) | Better Understanding and larger data through invertible networks |
# | [Future Work](future-work)   | Newer DL architectures such as transformers or invertible networks may allow better performance and better interpretability   |
