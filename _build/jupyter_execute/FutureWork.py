# -> Finally, I conclude with my thoughts on the current state of EEG deep learning decoding and promising avenues for further work like cross-dataset decoding models as well as models that can process larger timescales of EEG signals.
# 
# * Good results
# * Also possible through smaller networks
# * Well-known spectral features can explain a lot of the performance
# * Use or not? why not? also can show other interesting features
# * Future transformers cross-dataset and possibly larger timescales recording
