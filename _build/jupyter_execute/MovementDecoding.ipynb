    "Task-related and especially movement-related decoding problems are among the most researched paradigms in EEG decoding and were hence our problem choice for the first evaluation of deep learning on EEG. A typical setup is that subjects receive a cue for a specific body part (e.g. right hand, feet, tongue, etc.) and either move this body part (motor execution) or just imagine to move this part (motor imagery). The EEG signals acquired during the imagined or executed movements then often contain patterns specific to the body part that was moved or thought about. These patterns can then be decoded using machine learning."

    "To ensure that the results also generalize to further datasets and also rule out hyperparameter overfitting, the FBCSP pipeline and the deep network pipelines were applied with the exact same hyperparameters on BCI Competition IV 2b. A few choices like the use of the decoding time window had been done after already seeing results from the evaluation sets of the High-Gamma dataset and the BCIC IV 2a dataset, hence the BCIC IV 2b dataset seemed a suitable dataset for further validation of the pipelines. Results in {numref}`bcic-iv-2b-results` show that the networks perform as good or better than FBCSP.\n",

    "> Third, scalp maps of the input-perturbation effects on network predictions for the different frequency bands, as shown in Figure 19, show spatial distributions expected for motor tasks in the alpha, beta and—for the first time for such a noninvasive EEG decoding visualization—for the high gamma band. These scalp maps directly reflect the behavior of the ConvNets and one needs to be careful when making inferences about the data from them. For example, the positive correlation on the right side of the scalp for the Hand (R) class in the alpha band only means the ConvNet increased its prediction when the amplitude at these electrodes was increased independently of other frequency bands and electrodes. It does not imply that there was an increase of amplitude for the right hand class in the data. Rather, this correlation could be explained by the ConvNet reducing common noise between both locations, for more explanations of these effects in case of linear models, see Haufe et al. [2014]. Nevertheless, for the first time in noninvasive EEG, these maps clearly revealed the global somatotopic organization of causal contributions of motor cortical gamma band activity to decoding right and left hand and foot movements. Interestingly, these maps revealed highly focalized patterns, particularly during hand movement in the gamma frequency range (Fig. 16, first plots in last row), in contrast to the more diffuse patterns in the conventional task-related spectral analysis as shown in Figure 14."
